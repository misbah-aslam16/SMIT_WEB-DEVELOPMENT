    <h1>Matter</h1>
    <p id="mainpara">Matter is anything that takes up space and can be weighed. In other words, matter has volume and mass.Matter is a substance made up of various types of particles that occupies physical space and has inertia. According to the principles of modern physics, the various types of particles each have a specific mass and size.

        The most familiar examples of material particles are the electron, the proton and the neutron. Combinations of these particles form atoms.</p>
    <h1>Properties of matter</h1>
    <p id=firstpara>These are some properties of matter:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><h2>Melting point</h2></li>
    <p>The melting point of a substance is the temperature at which it changes state from<span id="1"> solid to liquid</span>. At the melting point the solid and liquid phase exist in <span>equilibrium.</span>Melting point, temperature at which the solid and liquid forms of a pure substance can exist in equilibrium. As heat is applied to a solid, its temperature will increase until the melting point is reached. More heat then will convert the solid into a liquid with no temperature change. When all the solid has melted, additional heat will raise the temperature of the liquid. The melting temperature of crystalline solids is a characteristic figure and is used to identify pure compounds and elements. Most mixtures and amorphous solids melt over a range of temperatures.

    The melting temperature of a solid is generally considered to be the same as the freezing point of the corresponding liquid; because a liquid may freeze in different crystal systems and because impurities lower the freezing point, however, the actual freezing point may not be the same as the melting point. Thus, for characterizing a substance, the melting point is preferred.</p>
    <li><h2>Boiling point</h2></li>
    <p>The boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid equals the pressure surrounding the liquid and the <span> liquid changes into a vapor.</span>
        
    The boiling point of the liquid depends upon the pressure of the surrounding. When the liquid is at high pressure, it has a higher boiling point than the boiling point at normal atmospheric pressure. The boiling point of different liquids is different for a given pressure. In 1982, IUPAC defined the standard boiling point of a liquid as the temperature at which the liquid boils under a pressure of 1 bar.The boiling point of a substance is dependent on the pressure of its surroundings. In mountainous terrains (where the altitude is high), the pressure of the atmosphere is relatively lower than the atmospheric pressure at sea level. This is the reason why food cooks at a slower pace in mountainous areas (the lower atmospheric pressure causes water to boil at temperatures below 100oC).
    When all the particles in the liquid phase have been transformed into the gas phase, the temperature begins to rise again, as long as heat is still being applied to the surrounding system. As the temperature starts to increase, so does the particle’s kinetic energy.</p>
    <li><h2>Density</h2></li>
    <p>Density is a physical property of matter that expresses a relationship of <span> mass to volume</span>. When materials of different densities are put in contact with one another, their densities will determine how they order themselves.Density is essentially a measurement of how tightly matter is packed together. It is a unique <b>chemical</b> physical property of a particular object. The principle of density was discovered by the Greek scientist Archimedes. It is easy to calculate density if you know the formula and understand the related units The symbol ρ represents density or it can also be represented by the letter <span>D.</span></p>
